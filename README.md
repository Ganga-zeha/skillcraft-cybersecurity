# SkillCraft Technology â€” Cybersecurity Internship

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
During my internship at **SkillCraft Technology**, I developed and tested a set of **educational cybersecurity tools** aimed at demonstrating basic encryption, password analysis, and system security concepts.  
These tools were created purely for **learning purposes** and follow ethical security practices.
